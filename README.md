    - **Tip: How to get a list of all your files**
        
        https://www.groovypost.com/howto/microsoft/list-directory-contents-to-a-printable-and-readable-txt-file/
        
        One quick way to get a list of all the files in your folder is the ‚Äútree‚Äù command. 
        
        On Windows: 
        
        ```bash
        where tree        //to see the utility installed in system32
        help tree         //to see how use this utility
        tree /f           //to display the names of files in each folder
        ```
        
        On a Mac
        
        ```flow
        brew install tree            //to install the tree utility
        man tree                     //to see how to use this command
        tree                         //to show listing of files
        ```
 ## Instructions***
 How to install or run the project
    
    <aside>
    üí° **The main point here is to tell the new developer how to use the GitHub repo to begin working on your web app, including:**
    
    1. What does the developer need to install (don‚Äôt leave anything out!) like:
        1. language(s)
        2. IDEs
        3. Database(s)
        4. Other software
    2. Which 3rd party APIs and frameworks does the developer need to download?
    3. Do they need any API keys?
    4. In which order should they install things? Does installation location matter?
    5. Include detailed configuration instructions.
    6. Include a link to the testing plan you have completed so the new developer can see your testing history and maybe contribute to a minor bugfix!
    7. ***In a separate plaintext file called passwords.txt that has NOT been added to your repo, provide us with any admin/user/server login IDs and passwords. Don‚Äôt add this to your repo, especially if your repo is public! Upload this plaintext file to the 05d Dropbox in D2L.***
