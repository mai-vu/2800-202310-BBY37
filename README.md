 ## Instructions***
 How to install or run the project
    
    <aside>
    ðŸ’¡ **The main point here is to tell the new developer how to use the GitHub repo to begin working on your web app, including:**
    
    1. What does the developer need to install (donâ€™t leave anything out!) like:
        1. language(s)
        2. IDEs
        3. Database(s)
        4. Other software
    2. Which 3rd party APIs and frameworks does the developer need to download?
    3. Do they need any API keys?
    4. In which order should they install things? Does installation location matter?
    5. Include detailed configuration instructions.
    6. Include a link to the testing plan you have completed so the new developer can see your testing history and maybe contribute to a minor bugfix!
    7. ***In a separate plaintext file called passwords.txt that has NOT been added to your repo, provide us with any admin/user/server login IDs and passwords. Donâ€™t add this to your repo, especially if your repo is public! Upload this plaintext file to the 05d Dropbox in D2L.***

## AI Usages
    1. Did you use AI to help create your app? If so, how? Be specific.
    We used AI to assist in troubleshooting and fixing syntactical errors in JavaScript code. 
    We learned a lot about refactoring and writing more effective code through the examples provided by ChatGPT.

    2. Did you use AI to create datasets or clean datasets? If so, how? Be specific.
    We did not utilize AI to generate or modify datasets.

    3. Does your app use AI? If so, how? Be specific.
    We integrated the ChatGPT API to generate suggestions for utilizing commonly discarded food items. 
    While we initially sought existing recipe datasets for leftover or perishable foods, we ultimately opted 
    for ChatGPT as it enables us to offer accessible instructions with well-phrased guidance on the spot.

    4. Did you encounter any limitations? What were they, and how did you overcome them? Be specific.
    Initially, our food waste feature, which relied on ChatGPT's responses, lacked consistency and presented 
    a significant obstacle. We overcame this challenge through persistent trial and error, 
    persevering until we achieved the desired results.
